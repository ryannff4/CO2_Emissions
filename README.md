# CO2_Emissions
This project will display a visual of the CO2 emissions per country on a world map. The visual will also be interactive such that the user can manipulate the year in order to see the change in emissions over time.

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with various Python packages while also trying to bring some personal connection into programming - in this case, my personal interest in the environment.

Note that in order to have the application properly run in an interactive manner, simply executing the program is not enough. A bokeh server must be started and this can be done with the following command in the terminal:
>>bokeh serve --show co2_visual.py

The --show flag will open the application in a new tab in your default internet browser.
